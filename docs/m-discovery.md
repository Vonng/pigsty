# Service Discovery

Service discovery has various uses, and this article describes the mechanism used by the Pigsty monitoring system Prometheus to discover monitoring objects.

The basis of service discovery is **identity**, for more information about identity, please refer to the section [**entity**](c-entity.md)

Once you have the identity, you also need to associate **monitoring targets** with the identity in the monitoring system, and Pigsty provides two implementations.

* [Static File Service Discovery](#static-file-service-discovery)ï¼š using an automatically maintained configuration file (default)
* [Consul service discovery](Consul-service-discovery): uses automatically maintained Consul service registration information

The static file is the default service discovery mechanism. Before v1.0.0, Consul was the default service discovery method, and the discovery mechanism could be configured via parameters.




## Identity

All instances have an **Identity** and the **Identifier** is the **metadata** associated with the instance to identify it.

[**identity parameter**](v-pgsql.md#pg_identity) is a unique identifier that must be defined for any cluster with an instance.

| name | variables | abbreviation | type | description |
| :--: | :-----------: | ------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| cluster | `pg_cluster` | `cls` | **Core identity parameters** | Cluster name, top-level namespace for resources within the cluster |
| role | `pg_role` | `role` | **core identity parameters** | instance role, `primary`, `replica`, `offline`,... |
| seq | `pg_seq` | `seq` | **core identity parameters** | Instance serial number, positive integer, unique within the cluster. |
| instance | `pg_instance` | `ins` | derived identity parameters | `${pg_cluster}-${pg_seq}` |
| service | `pg_service` | `svc` | derived identity parameters | `${pg_cluster}-${pg_role}` |

## Attach Identity

After naming the objects in the system, you also need to associate **identity information** to specific instances.

Identity information is business-given metadata, and the database instance itself is not aware of this identity information; it does not know who it serves, which business it is subordinate to, or what number of instances it is in the cluster.

Identity assignment can take many forms, and the most rudimentary way to associate identities is **Operator's memory**: the DBA remembers in his mind that the database instance on IP address `10.2.3.4` is the one used for payments, while the database instance on the other one is used for user management. A better way to manage the identity of cluster members is through the **profile**, or by using **service discovery**.

Pigsty provides both ways of identity management: service discovery based on the [**Consul**](#consul-service-discovery), and service discovery based on the [**config file**](#static-file-service-discovery).

The parameter [`prometheus_sd_method`](v-infra.md#prometheus_sd_method) controls this behavior.

- `consul`: service discovery based on Consul, default config
- `static`: service discovery based on local configuration files

Pigsty recommends using `static` service discovery, which is more concise and has more reliability as the monitoring system does not need to rely on Consul.



## Static File Service Discovery

Static file service discovery is the default method of monitoring object discovery and Pigsty pulls the config using the following config by default.

```yaml
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# job: pgsql (database monitoring)
# node_exporter | pg_exporter | pgbouncer_exporter | haproxy(exporter)
# labels: [cls, ins, instance]
# path: targets/pgsql/*.yml
#------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- job_name: pgsql
  metrics_path: /metrics
  file_sd_configs:
    - refresh_interval: 10s
      files: [ /etc/prometheus/targets/pgsql/*.yml ]
```

The `/etc/prometheus/targets` dir holds the monitoring object definition files generated by Pigsty, and `pgsql` is the name of the default environment.

**Each instance is register by a standalone file:**

```
/etc/prometheus/targets/pgsql
                     ^-----pg-meta-1.yml
                     ^-----pg-test-1.yml
                     ^-----pg-test-2.yml
                     ^-----pg-test-3.yml
```

Its content is the **identity identifier** on a single instance node, with **monitoring objects**.

```bash
# pg-meta-1 [primary] @ 10.10.10.10
- labels: { cls: pg-meta, ins: pg-meta-1 }
  targets: [10.10.10.10:9630, 10.10.10.10:9100, 10.10.10.10:9631, 10.10.10.10:9101]
```

The advantages of static file service discovery are that there are no additional component dependencies and that it allows manual intervention for management and tuning, as well as easy integration with third-party systems.

### Maintenance Document Service Discovery

When using static file service discovery, these config files are automatically maintained for all cluster expansion and scaling operations.

Using the following command, the config files will be regenerated for all instances in the environment

```bash
./pgsql.yml -t register_prometheus
```

### Default Targets

Each managed Postgres instance includes several capture ports.

* [Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) for capturing machine node metrics
* [PG Exporter](https://github.com/Vonng/pg_exporter) for capturing database metrics
* [PGBouncer Exporter](https://github.com/Vonng/pg_exporter) for capturing connection pool metrics (uses the same binary as PG Exporter)
* [Patroni](https://patroni.readthedocs.io/en/latest/releases.html?highlight=%2Fmetrics#version-2-1-3) for capturing high availability components
* [HAProxy](https://github.com/Vonng/haproxy-rpm) for capturing load balancer metrics (built-in support, no separate deployment required)

These capture ports are captured by Prometheus on the [meta node](c-arch.md#meta-node).
In addition, the optional Promtail for collecting Postgres, Patroni, and Pgbouncer logs is an optional additional installed component.

By default, all monitoring endpoints are registered to Consul, but Prometheus manages these tasks by default using static file service discovery.
Users can use Consul service discovery by configuring [`prometheus_sd_method`](v-infra.md#prometheus_sd_method) as `consul` to dynamically manage instances.



## Consul Service Discovery

Pigsty has built-in DCS-based config management and automatic service discovery, allowing users to visualize all nodes and services in the system, as well as their health status. All services in Pigsty are automatically registered with DCS, so metadata is automatically corrected when database clusters are created, destroyed, or modified, and the monitoring system can automatically discover monitoring targets, eliminating the need for manual config maintenance. The monitoring system can automatically discover the monitoring targets, eliminating the need for manual config maintenance.

Users can also use the DNS and service discovery mechanism provided by Consul to achieve automatic DNS-based traffic switching.

Consul adopts a Client/Server architecture, with one to five Consul Servers in the entire env for the actual metadata storage. Consul Agent is deployed on all nodes to proxy the communication between local services and the Consul Server. Pigsty registers services by default using local Consul config files.

### Service Registration

On each node, a consul agent is running, and services are registered to DCS by the consul agent using JSON config files.

The default location of the JSON config file is `/etc/consul.d/`, using the naming convention of `svc-<service>.json`, taking `postgres` as an example.

```json
{
  "service": {
    "name": "postgres",
    "port": 5432,
    "tags": [
      "pgsql",
      "primary",
      "pg-meta"
    ],
    "meta": {
      "type": "postgres",
      "role": "primary",
      "seq": "1",
      "instance": "pg-meta-1",
      "service": "pg-meta-primary",
      "cluster": "pg-meta",
      "version": "13"
    },
    "check": {
      "args": ["/usr/pgsql/bin/pg_isready", "-p", "5432", "-U", "dbuser_monitor"],
      "interval": "15s",
      "timeout": "1s"
    }
  }
}
```

Where the `meta` and `tags` sections are the metadata of the service and store the **identity information** of the instance.

### Service Inquiry

Users can discover **services registered to Consul** through the DNS service provided by Consul, or by calling the Consul API directly

See [Consul doc](https://www.consul.io/docs/discovery/dns) for ways to consult consul services using the DNS API.

### Service Discovery

Prometheus automatically discovers monitored objects in the env via `consul_sd_configs`. Services tagged with both `pg` and `exporter` are automatically identified as crawlers:


```yaml
- job_name: pg
  # https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/configuration/#consul_sd_config
  consul_sd_configs:
    - server: localhost:8500
      refresh_interval: 5s
      tags:
        - pg
        - exporter
```

> **Figure: In services discovered by Prometheus**, identity information has been associated with the metric dimension of the instance.


### Service Maintenance

Sometimes, the registered role deviates from the actual role of the database instance because of a database master-slave switch. This is when such anomalies need to be handled through the anti-entropy process. Patroni-based failover can correct the registered roles normally through callback logic, but manually done role switchover requires manual intervention to handle it. Service registrations to the database can be detected and fixed automatically using the following script. It is recommended to configure Crontab on the database instance or set up periodic patrol tasks on the meta-node.


```bash
/pg/bin/pg-register $(pg-role)
```





## Labels

Either through Consul or static file service discovery. The end effect is to achieve an association between **identity information** and **collected time series**.

This correlation is achieved through the **dimensional labels** of the monitoring metrics, not all of which have the following labels.

However, all original monitoring metrics related to database clusters in Pigsty must have both `cls` and `ins` tags and remain immutable throughout their lifecycle.

| Identity parameters | Dimension labels | Sample values |
| :-----------: | :------: | :---------------: |
| `pg_cluster` | `cls` | `pg-test` |
| `pg_instance` | `ins` | `pg-test-1` |
| `node_ip` | `ip` | `10.10.10.11` |
