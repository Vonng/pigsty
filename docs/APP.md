# Applications

Lots of software using PostgreSQL. Pigsty has some docker compose template for some popular software.

You can launch stateless software with docker easily and using external HA PostgreSQL for higher availability & durability.

You can use Docker to deploy and launch software applications quickly. You can directly access the PostgreSQL/Redis database deployed on the host in the container using the connection string.

Docker is **not** installed by default, You can install docker with `docker.yml` playbook, e.g.: `./docker.yml -l infra`
