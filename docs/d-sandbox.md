# Sandbox

> Pigsty supports both [local sandbox](#local-sandbox) and [cloud sandbox](#cloud-sandbox) for quickly [preparing](d-prepare.md) a standard 1/4 node demo environment locally or in the cloud.

Pigsty provides a **sandbox environment**. Ultimately creating and running through the sandbox installation and deployment process for deployment in production envs have Pigsty very helpful.



## Introduction

The config specifications, object identities, and default database **predetermined** environment of the sandbox are consistent in both the local and cloud versions.

The sandbox meta node IP is fixed to: `10.10.10.10`. `10.10.10.10` is also a placeholder for the IP of the meta node in all config templates, which is used as the actual IP of the meta node when executing [config](v-config.md# configuration procedure).

You can use a single-node sandbox with a `meta`, deployed with complete infrastructure, and a single instance Postgres database `pg-meta`.

* `meta    10.10.10.10  pg-meta.pg-meta-1`

The single-node sandbox is suitable for personal development, experimentation, and learning; the four-node sandbox can demonstrate Pigsty's capabilities, data analysis and visualization, design, demonstration, and distribution of interactive data applications. Please select as you need.

There are three additional nodes in the four-node sandbox, with a set of three-node PostgreSQL cluster `pg-test`.

* `node-1  10.10.10.11  pg-test.pg-test-1`
* `node-2  10.10.10.12  pg-test.pg-test-2`
* `node-3  10.10.10.13  pg-test.pg-test-3`

Also, the sandbox will use the following two IPs with two static DNS records for accessing the database cluster.

* `10.10.10.2  pg-meta`
* `10.10.10.2  pg-test`



Pigsty offers a local sandbox based on Vagrant (pulling up local VMs using Virtualbox), and a cloud sandbox based on Terraform (creating VMs using the cloud vendor API).

* Local sandbox can be run on Mac/PC for free. If running a full 4-node sandbox, your Mac/PC should have at least 4C/8G.

* Cloud sandbox can be easily shown and shared. You need to create a cloud account. VM resources are created and used on-demand and can be destroyed with one click after use, which is also very cheap.





## Local Sandbox

The Pigsty local sandbox relies on [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) to host the local [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) VM.

Before using Pigsty sandbox, you need to install Vagrant and Virtualbox in your operating system. You can also create VMs for [standard installation and deployment](d-deploy.md) by choosing other VM software (Parallel Desktop, VMWare).


### Quick Start

Make sure that [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) and [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) are installed and available. On macOS, you can use `homebrew` to install both with one click (requires reboot).

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)" # Install homebrew
brew install vagrant virtualbox # Installing Vagrant and Virtualbox on a MacOS host
```

 You can install software dependencies on macOS, configure local static DNS, and pull up VMs with the following four shortcutS. A few additional manual steps are required under Windows and Linux.

```bash
make deps    # Install homebrew, and install vagrant and virtualbox via homebrew (requires reboot)
make dns     # Write a static domain name to local /etc/hosts (requires sudo password)
make start   # Pull up a single meta node using Vagrant (4 nodes for start4)
```

Next, you can `ssh meta` to log in to the default meta node. SSH sudo for the meta node access to all nodes is already configured, and you can execute the Pigsty installation.



### Vagrant

Local VM configuration is relatively cumbersome, and [**Vagrant**](https://www.vagrantup.com/) can solve this problem.

Vagrant makes it fast and straightforward to pull several VMs on a laptop, PC, or Mac, depending on the user's needs. Users need to express their requirements for VMs in a **vagrant configuration file**.

We have provided a sample Vagrant configuration file. [https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/blob/master/vagrant/Vagrantfile](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/blob/master/vagrant/Vagrantfile)

In the Vagrant configuration file, four VMs, including a 2-core/4GB central control/meta node `meta` and three 1-core/1GB **database nodes** `node-1, node-2, node3`.

When using the sandbox via shortcuts like `make up`, `make new`, and `make demo`, only one meta node `meta` is used by default. And `make up4`, `make new4`, and `make demo4` use all the VMs. The `N` value defines the number of additional database nodes. The user can also modify the number of CPU cores and memory resources per machine, etc.

<details><summary>Vagrantfile Example</summary>

```ruby
IMAGE_NAME = "centos/7"
N=3  # Number of database machine nodes, can be modified to 0

Vagrant.configure("2") do |config|
    config.vm.box = IMAGE_NAME
    config.vm.box_check_update = false
    config.ssh.insert_key = false

    # Meta Nodes
    config.vm.define "meta", primary: true do |meta|  # The default ssh alias for the meta node is `meta`
        meta.vm.hostname = "meta"
        meta.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.10.10.10"
        meta.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
            v.linked_clone = true
            v.customize [
                    "modifyvm", :id,
                    "--memory", 4096, "--cpus", "2",   # Memory and CPU cores for meta nodes: default is 2 cores/4GB
                    "--nictype1", "virtio", "--nictype2", "virtio",
                    "--hwvÂ·irtex", "on", "--ioapic", "on", "--rtcuseutc", "on", "--vtxvpid", "on", "--largepages", "on"
                ]
        end
        meta.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision.sh"
    end

    # Initialize N database nodes
    (1..N).each do |i|
        config.vm.define "node-#{i}" do |node|  # The default ssh aliases for the database nodes are `node-{1,2,3}`
            node.vm.box = IMAGE_NAME
            node.vm.network "private_network", ip: "10.10.10.#{i + 10}"
            node.vm.hostname = "node-#{i}"
            node.vm.provider "virtualbox" do |v|
                v.linked_clone = true
                v.customize [
                        "modifyvm", :id,
                        "--memory", 2048, "--cpus", "1", # Database node memory and CPU cores: default is 1 core/2GB
                        "--nictype1", "virtio", "--nictype2", "virtio",
                        "--hwvirtex", "on", "--ioapic", "on", "--rtcuseutc", "on", "--vtxvpid", "on", "--largepages", "on"
                    ]
            end
            node.vm.provision "shell", path: "provision.sh"
        end
    end
end
```

</details>

The `vagrant` binary will invoke Virtualbox by default to complete the creation of the local VMs defined in the Vagrant configuration file. Go to `vagrant` in the Pigsty root directory and execute `vagrant up` to bring up the four VMs. The [`Makefile`](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/blob/master/Makefile#L365) provides some wrappers for the original `vagrant` command.

The default VM image used by the sandbox is `IMAGE_NAME = "centos/7"`.



### Virtualbox

[Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) is an open-source and free cross-platform VM software. Installing Virtualbox on MacOS is very simple: `brew install virtualbox`, similar to other OS.

After installing Virtualbox, you may need to reboot your computer to load the VM kernel module. Pigsty requires an x86_64 runtime environment, and Macbooks with M1 chips installed may not be able to run Virtualbox properly.



### DNS Config

Pigsty accesses all web systems via **domain name** by default. If you do not have a DNS server or public domain name, you can use local static DNS records. The static DNS records used by the sandbox are shown below.

```bash
# pigsty dns records
10.10.10.10 meta pigsty c.pigsty g.pigsty l.pigsty p.pigsty a.pigsty cli.pigsty lab.pigsty api.pigsty matrix.pigsty
10.10.10.11 node-1   # sandbox node node-1
10.10.10.12 node-2   # sandbox node node-2
10.10.10.13 node-3   # sandbox node node-3
10.10.10.2  pg-meta  # sandbox vip for pg-meta
10.10.10.3  pg-test  # sandbox vip for pg-test
```

On macOS and Linux, running `sudo make dns` will write the above records to `/etc/hosts` (requires sudo access). On Windows, you will need to add them manually to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.






----------------


## Cloud Sandbox

You can also use cloud VMs that are ready to use and destroy.

### Terraform

[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is an open-source and free infrastructure or code tool. Just declare the required cloud VMs, network, security group configurations, etc., and pull up the corresponding resources with one click.

To install Terraform under MacOS, execute `brew install terraform`. You will need a cloud account to obtain AccessKey and AccessSecret credentials.




### Config file

The project root dir `terraform/` provides Terraform files for several cloud vendors. You can use these templates to quickly request VM resources on the cloud for Pigsty deployment. Here is an example of Ali cloud.

```bash
cd terraform        # Go to the terraform dir
vi alicloud.tf      # Edit the config file, fill in your AliCloud AccessKey and SecretKey
```

### Execution Plan

First, use the `terraform` command to create the cloud resource defined above (Pay on demand).

```bash
terraform init      # Install terraform provider: aliyun (required only for the first time)
terraform apply     # Generate execution plans: create VMs, virtual segments/switches/security groups
```

After running `apply` and entering yes, terraform will call AliCloud API to create the corresponding VM resource.

<details><summary>Terraform Execution Results</summary>

```bash
Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:

### SSH Config and Tweaking

The manager will assign a pay-per-use public IP, which you can also print out using the command `terraform output`.

```bash
# Print public IP and root password
ssh_pass='PigstyDemo4'
public_ip=$(terraform output | grep -Eo '[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}')
echo "meta node: root:${ssh_pass}@${public_ip}"
```

Next, let's configure the local SSH login to the cloud manager (default user `root`, password `PigstyDemo4`).

```bash
# Create ~/.ssh/pigsty_terraform file containing SSH definitions for the cloud manager (optional)
cat > ~/.ssh/pigsty_terraform <<-EOF
Host demo
  User root
  HostName ${public_ip}
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  PasswordAuthentication yes
EOF
chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/pigsty_terraform 

# Enable this config
if ! grep --quiet "Include ~/.ssh/pigsty_terraform" ~/.ssh/config ; then
    (echo 'Include ~/.ssh/pigsty_terraform' && cat ~/.ssh/config) >  ~/.ssh/config.tmp;
    mv ~/.ssh/config.tmp ~/.ssh/config && chmod 0600 ~/.ssh/config;
fi
```

You can access the cloud manager via the SSH alias `demo`.

```bash
# Add local to meta node for password-free access
sshpass -p ${ssh_pass} ssh-copy-id demo 
```

Now, it is possible to access the node from the local password-free. If only a single node installation is required, this will do. Next, complete the standard installation on that meta node.


### DNS Config

Pigsty accesses all web systems via **domain name** by default and does not recommend using IP: Port to access the primary system's web interface.

The static DNS records used by the cloud sandbox are shown below, and you need to fill in the public IP of the meta node.

```bash
<public_ip> meta pigsty c.pigsty g.pigsty l.pigsty p.pigsty a.pigsty cli.pigsty lab.pigsty api.pigsty matrix.pigsty
```

In macOS and Linux, you need to write the above records to `/etc/hosts` (requires sudo access), and in Windows, you need to add them manually to `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`.



### Caveat

The AliCloud VM CentOS 7.8 mirror runs with `nscd`, which locks out the glibc version and causes RPM dependency errors during installation.

Run `yum remove -y nscd` on all machines to resolve this issue.
