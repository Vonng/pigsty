There's an active Pigsty community. Search WeChat `pigsty-cc` and join the user group.

Most answers cloud be found in [FAQ](s-faq.md). If there's no answer to your questions, you can ask in the community.

It's most welcome to create [Issues](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/issues/new/choose) or [Pull Requests](https://github.com/Vonng/pigsty/pulls) if you find some repeatable bugs.

Following information cloud helps a lot when asking for help:

* What commands are you typing?
* What result do you expect?
* What environment is used?
  * Is it a CentOS 7.9 fresh node? 
  * Is it a physical/virtual machine, or a public cloud ECS?
  * Is anything else running on that node?
  * Is offline package`pkg.tgz` been used?
    * If yes, in `/tmp/pkg.tgz`, right?
    * If not, do you have proper Internet access?
  * Is there any special restriction ? (such as firewall, ssh ban, etc...)
